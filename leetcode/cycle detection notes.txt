notes on cycle detection:

In linked list:
use floyd's hare tortoise algo to detect loop 

detect the start of ll:
start from head of linked list and point where fast met slow . iterate untill they meet . this is the beginning of loop.


DAG loop:

DFS when it produces back edge.
can color edges g,b,w or use visiting set with making adjacency list empty to or another set to do the same.

Undirected graph:

Use union find. if absolute parents are different(find op) , then add one edge at a time : union 
if absolute parent are same then adding edge will introduce cycle
